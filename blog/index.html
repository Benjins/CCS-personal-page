	<p>When writing C++ code, a common trade-off is virtual or static dispatch.  Virtual dispatch is C++'s way of implementing dynamic dispatch, and allows for greater flexibility.  A base class can have several child classes, and each can override the virtual method.  This then allows for the method to be chosen at runtime, as opposed to compile-time.</p>
	<p>However, virtual methods aren't without issues.  Although the extent is debated, they carry some runtime penalty.  A static method simply executes a known function, but a virtual method requires jumping across two pointers to find the proper function.  This can cause cache misses, and slows down execution.</p>
	<p>Balancing these two is common, and functionality will often move from virtual to static methods as optimization becomes more important, and flexibility is less needed.</p>
	<p>To this end, I "came up" with an idea that's probably been done all over the place.  But, I thought it was neat, so here:</p>
	<blockquote>For each virtual method in a class, have it delegate to a corresponding non-virtual method where the actual work is done.</blockquote>
	<blockquote class="line-number"><pre><code>
	<span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="type">Component</span> {
		<span class="comment">// Fields ...</span>
		
		<span class="keyword">public: </span>
		<span class="keyword">virtual void</span> Activate() = 0;
		
		<span class="keyword">virtual</span> ~Component(){}
	}
	</blockquote></code></pre>
	<p>Which is then subclassed to:</p>
	<blockquote class="line-number"><pre><code>
	<span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="type">SlyComponent</span> : <span class="type">Component</span>{
		<span class="comment">// Fields ...</span>
		
		<span class="keyword">public: </span>
		<span class="keyword">virtual void</span> Activate(){
			ActivateSly();
		}
		
		<span class="keyword">void</span> ActivateSly();
		
		<span class="keyword">virtual</span> ~SlyComponent(){}
	}
	</blockquote></code></pre>
