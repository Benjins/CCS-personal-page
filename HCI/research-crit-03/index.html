	<p>I was surprised at the nature of this paper.  It seemed less formal, and more geared towards practicality than a lot of papers.  Because of that, I actually thought it was a really good paper, but it did seem to lack some of the academic rigidity in most studies.  The paper talked about applying an old approach to prototyping to a new kind of device, and effectively gave tips on what designers should do.</p>  

	<p>This is useful to designers, but it seems to be a bit too anecdotal.  All it is is their personal experiences, and some advice.  It seems too qualitative.  It is possible that they conducted many tests with users (or at least more than the paper seemed to imply), but it still seems to lack as much authority as a true user study.  That being said, I am still glad that someone went out and did this, I'm just less sure if it fits into academia.</p>  

	<p>As for the specific content, I felt it was a topic that certainly could be explored.  It may seem futuristic to have more than one screen, but people already do it.  We have Facebook on our phones and on our computers, sometimes at the same time.  And with devices like the Chromecast, people are starting to connect smaller personal devices with larger shared ones.  So multi-screen devices are certainly relevant, it's just a question as to whether truly collaborative applications like they talked about will become common.</p>
