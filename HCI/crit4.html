<h4>Crit 04: Usability Evaluation Considered Harmful (Some of the Time), Buxton & Greenberg</h4>

<p>While I can appreciate the general message of the paper, I have to take fault with a few of the details.  Firstly, it seems like this mostly focused on preaching about what's already known.  They do provide examples, but it's ultimately "usability testing isn't always the best idea," something which should be known to most already.  The paper discusses how it can reduce the generation of alternative ideas for an interface, and instead lead to polishing a single one.  But that's more a case of doing user testing wrong.  Testing can be done with multiple interfaces to see which is preferred, or it can lead to some ideas being scrapped entirely and starting over.</p>  

<p>Yes, sometimes testing can make good ideas seem bad, but that's better than not knowing what users will think of it.  If a designer creates an interface, and never has actual users test it, then it will more than likely fail.  Any other method of evaluation just doesn't have the same grounding in real life.  The other examples they give of usability testing's faults are that they are rarely replicated, and that they are not as objective as claimed.  I have to disagree with their points here, because they're saying that subjective methods are equal to objective ones, when they can't really be compared.  Most objective studies have conclusions, but they back them up using facts.  Subjective methods of design might be useful for generating ideas, but they always need to be brought back to earth with proper testing.</p>

<p>The final point about replication of studies seems to be less a problem with usability testing, and more with the community.  If those studies are rarely replicated, or at least the replications are rarely published, then that's an issue with people, not with usability testing.  It does mean that, under real world circumstances, these studies lose some of their credibility.  But the data is still out there, meaning people can draw their own conclusions.  So overall, I think this paper doesn't bring much new, and I think they put too much on a couple small faults of usability testing.</p>
