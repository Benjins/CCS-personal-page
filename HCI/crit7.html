<h4>Benji Smith, Crit 7</h4>
<h4>Gould, et. al.</h4>

<p>Overall, I felt this was an interesting read.  At first, the principles they brought up seemed a bit like common knowledge, but I was willing to forgive that because this was from 1987.  However, afterward the paper (though it seemed more like an essay?) went into more specific stories to justify and expound upon their original three points.</p>

<p>The OMS itself was interesting to read about.  Any kind of multi-user messaging system that will be used from all over the world is impressive (esp. since this was before the web).  With over 17000 messages listened to, the technical and design challenges would be plentiful.  When it came to design, what they emphasised as important was getting rough drafts/sketches/ideas as soon as possible, and showing them to people related to the project (users, engineers, etc.).  Further, they kept going back to potential users about possible changes they would make.  While this does seem obvious at first, the paper goes into specifics.</p>

<p>For instance, they talk about talking with both olympians, and their families.  The OMS would have two distinct classes of users, and so they'd need to test its functionalities (different functions for each class) on both.  However, there were other, non-user groups they consulted.  They also talked to the contractors who would build the kiosk itself.  This is equivalent to designers talking to engineers, even if it's just a sanity check.</p>

<p>I also liked the effect tests had on their changes evaluation process.  The paper mentions (somewhat passive-aggressively) how sometimes a "powerful person proposed a significant, but poor, rewrite" of their documentation/user guide.  So, they'd let them draft a proposal, and test it with users.  This helps them have a platform for rejecting poor ideas, but also lets them know if the idea isn't bad after all.  Sometimes project managers can have useful input, and this helps filter the signal from the noise.</p>

<p>Overall, I thought it was a useful read, even as old as it is.</p>
