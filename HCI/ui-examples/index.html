	<h4>Example 1: Blender</h4>
	<p><i>Purpose: </i>Blender is a 3D modeling and rendering package.<p>
	<p>The good:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Consistent controls.  Moving, scaling, and rotating are always the same keys.  This applies to vertices, edges, faces, keyframes, video frames, etc.</li>
		<li>When selecting an object, arrows appear that can be dragged to move it.  This is one of the first functionalities a beginner learns, and it appears automatically.  Unfortunately, it does not imply to a beginner the more effective means of moving, i.e. the keyboard shortcut.</li>
		<li>Updating an object in one view updates it in all views.  This is especially useful when painting, which can be done in 2D or 3D.  When painting in 3D, the 2D view only updates after the stroke is completed (i.e. the user lets go of the mouse), while painting in 2D instantly updates in 3D.  This allows the user to see the same information in multiple contexts, and not have to update each one each time.</li>
		<li>When the user mouses over the area in the second image, their cursor changes to a cross.  This is used to indicate that a click and drag will create a new view, and is meant to draw in users, and teach them new functionality.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The bad:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Controls are not standard with other applications, even similar ones.  Right click is the default select button, but this can be remapped.</li>
		<li>User on-boarding is limited.  Most of the functionality is hidden with keyboard shortcuts, and it is difficult for a user to know how to do a task they have in mind, or even what it is called.</li>
	</ul>

<div style="width:1000px">
	<h4>Example 2: MA Jury Duty</h4>
	<p><i>Purpose: </i>The website for MA courts, and for responding to jury duty summons.<p>
	<p>The good:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The most common reason to go to the site is in response to a jury duty summons.  Therefore, on the main page of the site, there is a large button to respond to the summons.</li>
		<li>The language is clear, and tells the user what each step requires, and the choices available.</li>
		<li>The first page says that the form can be completed through the mail instead, </li>
		<li>For each page, the survey form is in a central box, which frames the important information and separates it from the site.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The bad:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The arrangement of text occasionally puts more emphasis on less important information.</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<div>
	<img width="400" src="img/rayman.png"/> 
</div>
<div style="width:1000px">
	<h4>Example 3: Rayman 3 Menu</h4>
	<p><i>Purpose: </i>Rayman 3 is a video game; this is regarding its pause menu.<p>
	<p>The good:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The main menu is standard: Options, Load, etc.  This is the screen that the menu defaults to, since it is likely the most used one.  Therefore, the most common functionality is the easiest to access.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The bad:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The controls are completely non-standard on the platform, and are clumsy.  There is no mouse control for the menu.  The left and right control keys move between menus, and backspace is resume.  Further, the controls for these functions cannot be altered.</li>
		<li>There is no indication of where a particular functionality is, so the user simply has to scroll through 4-10 menus looking for it.</li>
		<li>The absence of a usual feature (a manual button) is not mentioned or explained.  This is not addressed in the game proper either.</li>
	</ul>

<div style="width:1000px">
	<h4>Example 4: Eclipse</h4>
	<p><i>Purpose: </i>Eclipse is an IDE for several programming languages, e.g. Java.<p>
	<p>The good:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The menus are searchable, which means if the user knows the name, it's easier to find.  The search also looks in text within menus, not just titles.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The bad:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Functionality is often hidden in submenus, or hard to access menus.  Adjusting font size or colour requires right clicking on the gutter of the editor, as seen in the second picture above.</li>
		<li>Names are often non-standard or non-consistent.  In Project->Properties, there is a menu called Resource.  In it are things like path or environment variables.  Those are technically resources, but a more specific name would make navigating the menus easier.</li>
	</ul>
