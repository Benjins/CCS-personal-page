For my report, I chose to observe people using the quick-access computers in the main hall on the first floor of Ryder.  These are publicly available computers that are meant to be used for 5-10 minutes.  I chose this because I see many people there throughout the day, and there is sometimes a line that forms.  I went at two times: once in the afternoon with high traffic, and once in the evening with less traffic.  I focused on the activity and duration, but also on several other patterns that showed up.
</p>
<p>
Most people tended to only stay at these stations for 5-10 minutes, which is the expected time.  There was one major deviation: a student who sat at the station without using the computer for 30+ minutes.  He mostly engaged with using his phone, and seemed to just be waiting/killing time.  However, this was in the evening with less traffic, so there were several adjacent free stations.  This probably was what justified sitting there in his mind.  Another deviation was a group of two students who were on their way to class.  This was in the afternoon, with more traffic, and there were no free stations at that time.  However, they only stayed for about 15 minutes.  I interviewed them afterwards, which I will get to later.
</p>
<p>
The overwhelming majority of people using these stations were students, and only one professor was seen using the stations.  Most students checked email, Blackboard, or other school-related info.  Some of them used Facebook or other social media, though rarely was that the exclusive website in the session.  Most students also had their phones out, and would interact with them while pages loaded, or other wait-time.  
</p>
<p>
I feel that one area technology could help would be the process of accessing MyNEU, school email, or Blackboard.  Students already provide their MyNEU login info, so if the browser homepage was MyNEU, and already had their login info entered, it would expedite most students' use cases.  The potential drawback is obviously security, as there is potential for account credentials to be leaked.  However, the credentials are already entered to use the computers, so if possible it would prevent a second login.

The other major use case was printing.  4 students were observed printing from these machines, which was usually the only activity performed in the session.  The printer is located right next to the computers, which makes it a convenient spot to print from.  2 of the print jobs were under 5 pages, however the other 2 were print jobs of 15-20 pages total.  Here, printing could be made faster potentially by auto-entering the MyNEU username of that session into the username field for the print popup.  This would likely be less effective than the auto-login idea mentioned previously.  However, there are fewer issues of security with this idea.

The two students interviewed were together on their way to class.  One of them was using the quick-access computer, while the other was looking on over their shoulder.  The two of them were in the same class, and were checking the assignment due.  When asked why, one of them said "I have a bit of time before class, and I wanted to make sure that there wasn't something due that I'd forgotten."  The other agreed, adding "It sometimes doesn't even occur to me to check until I'm on my way to class, and it's hard to check on my phone."  They both had current smartphones, yet neither felt that using MyNEU or Blackboard on their phone was easier than using the quick-access machines.
