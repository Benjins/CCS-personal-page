	<h4 class="header">Tentative Title: PaperVC</h4>
	
	<h4 class="header">Problem:</h4>
	<p>Many academic paper writers use some form of version control.  However, most VC tools are geared toward programmers and technical pursuits.  As such, many co-authors will only use a subset of features of the program, and want a simplified piece of software.  Some even eschew software, and simply keep multiple files.</p>
	
	<h4 class="header">Users:</h4>
	<p>The main target audience for this product is academic paper writers.  Users will be grad students, post docs, PI's, or anyone else involved in the paper writing process.  Users will generally be:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>24-40 years old</li>
		<li>Often working long hours</li>
		<li>Use technology often, but not necessarily very technically-minded</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4 class="header">Personas:</h4>
	<p>Sally is a physics grad student working toward her PhD.  This is her second year of research.  She is currently the main researcher and author of a paper, which is written using LaTex.  She and her 3 co-authors make revisions, which need to be looked over by her PI.  She needs a way to be able to track changes and potentially undo based on feedback from her PI.</p>
	<p>Josh is the PI of a neuroscience lab.  He is 34 years old.  He has about 10 researchers working under him.  At any given time, there are multiple research projects the lab is working on.  A few times each week, Josh looks over the latest versions of each project and the corresponding paper.  He checks the latest revisions to see what was changed, and get a sense of the progress of the work.</p>

Hit 'Make Revision' button."><p>If you see this, your browser doesn't support SVG rendering or object tags.</p></object>
	<p class="prob-scenario"><span style="font-weight: 500;">Problem scenario:</span> Sally has just finished making some edits to a section of her paper.  She wants to put them into version control, so that her co-authors can access them.  However, she also has other sections she wants to work on, and doesn't want to break her workflow.  Before she puts them into version control, she also wants to look over what she changed, to make sure she's submitting the work she wants to submit.</p>

	<p class="prob-scenario"><span style="font-weight: 500;">Problem scenario:</span> Josh received some revisions recently from one of his researchers.  After he looks them over, he decides that they aren't good enough, and thinks they should be reverted.  He wants to look over what has changed in those sections recently, to see if a revert is necessary.  He checks what's changed recently, and decides to revert to a version from earlier in the week.</p>

	<p class="prob-scenario"><span style="font-weight: 500;">Problem scenario:</span> Josh wants to start a new paper.  He needs to add some pre-emptive work he's done, and send it out to his co-authors.</p>

	<h4 class="header">Usability:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>The time it takes a user to create a revision: under 20 seconds.  Measured from leaving their text editor to coming back to it (effectively measuring loss of productivity).</li>
		<li>On a 1-7 scale for "How easy is it to navigate to a past revision, if you know what the contents of the revision was?": at least 4 or 5.</li>
	</ul>
