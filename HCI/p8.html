<h4>Executive Summary</h4>
<p>This study was to evaluate the status of the PaperVC prototype.  7 Participants participated in the study.  Each participant was given a briefing, and asked to complete 3 tasks.</p>

<h5>Briefing:</h5>
<p>Hello, thank you for participating in this evaluation study.  My name is Benji, and I will be guiding you through the study.  It should take about 15 minutes to complete.  You are here to help judge the interface for PaperVC, a version control system for academic writers.  Here is what the interface looks like [SHORT DEMO].  You will be given three tasks, and asked to complete them as best you can using this interface.  You can give any feedback or thoughts while performing the tasks.  After the tasks are done, we will have specific questions we'd like you to answer, and if you have any final thoughts be sure to share them.  Finally, keep in mind that we are judging the interface, not you, and so any issues you have will be considered when redesigning the interface.  Thank you again, and let's begin.</p>

<h4>Methodology</h4>
<h5>Who we tested</h5>
<p>7 participants, having the following characteristics, evaluated PaperVC.</p>  

<p>Audience age breakdown</p>
<table>
<tr><td>Age</td>   <td>#</td></tr>
<tr><td>18-25</td> <td>7</td></tr>	   
<tr><td>26-39</td> <td>0</td></tr>	   
<tr><td>40-59</td> <td>0</td></tr>	   
<tr><td>60-74</td> <td>0</td></tr>	   
<tr><td>TOTAL</td> <td>7</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Audience gender breakdown</p>
<table>
<tr><td>Gender</td> <td>#</td></tr>
<tr><td>Women</td>	<td>2</td></tr>	   
<tr><td>Men</td>	<td>5</td></tr>
<tr><td>TOTAL</td> 	<td>7</td></tr> 
</table>
	 
<h4>What participants did</h4>
<p>Each participant met with the study coordinator for about 15 minutes.  After completing tasks, they were given a questionnaire to fill out regarding their thoughts on the prototype.</p>
<p>What data we collected</p>
<ul>
 <li>How easily the users completed tasks, vs. how confused they were.</li>
 <li>Verbal feedback from the user.</li>
 <li>Questionnaire answers.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Major findings and recommendations</h4>
<ul>
 <li>Use of word 'Snapshot' is confusing.  Minor.  Likely will change to 'Revision'.</li>
 <li>No participants used keyboard shortcuts, or even tried to.</li>
 <li>Lack of collaboration features.  Major.  Likely won't get to fix.</li>
 <li>Some users stumbled over folder history layout.  Minor.  Likely will redesign shape of folder.</li>
</ul>
 
<h4>Detailed findings and recommendations</h4>
<h5>Questionnaire Questions &amp; Tasks</h5> 
<ul>
<li>Was the experience you had with this software faster than your normal version control routine? (1: Much slower .. 7: Much faster)
Responses: {2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1} Mean: 2.4, Median: 2</li>
<li>Was the experience you had with this software smoother than your normal routine? (1: Much more jarring .. 7: Much smoother)
Responses: {3, 4, 3, 3, 3, 4, 3} Mean: 3.3, Median: 3</li>
<li>Do you think you'd be prone to make fewer errors with this software than with your normal routine? (1: Many fewer errors .. 7:Many more errors)
Responses: {3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3} Mean: 2.6, Median: 3</li>
<li>Would you recommend this software to someone with little experience in version control software? (1: Not at all .. 7: Definitely)
Responses: {5, 4, 6, 4, 3, 3, 3} Mean: 4, Median: 4</li>
</ul>

<h5>Tasks:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Find out what outstanding changes there are</li>
<li>Create a new revision</li>
<li>Find out what was changed in the past 3 revisions</li>
</ul>
