<h1>Project Ideas</h1>
<h3>Idea 1: Programming IDE</h3>
<div style="width:1000px">
<p>Programming is almost always done with a tool that goes beyond just editing text.  For many beginners, IDE's tend toward visual editing, with blocks or nodes.  Intermediate IDE's are more like traditional text editors with extensive GUI's and menus.  And advanced IDE's often use convoluted shortcuts to squeeze a few extra edits per minute.  As programmers progress, they often change IDE's, but also change the style and philosophy of input.  This IDE would like to have a unified interface that scales from beginner to expert.</p>

<h3>Idea 2: Visual Git Client</h3>
<div style="width:1000px">
<p>Even with non-command-line interfaces, Git clients are often unintuitive to users, forcing them to learn concepts like commit, branch, or merge.  This client would seek to make learning to use it easier, mostly by adopting a visual interface that shows file/repository history.  Branches would be shown in a visual manner, and merging would be done by simply dragging one commit onto another.</p>

<h3>Idea 3: Adaptive Touch Interface for Typing</h3>
<div style="width:1000px">
<p>Touch interfaces are common among people with motor disabilities, who may also have speech impairments.  These touch devices often are placed in a fixed position relative to the user.  Because of this, some areas may be easier to reach than others.  This project would explore the ability to determine which areas are best through a calibration, and then the ability to adjust a typing UI to better match the user's capabilities.</p>
