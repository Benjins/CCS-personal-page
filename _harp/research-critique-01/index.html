<p>I feel that this research paper is certainly useful for interaction design, though I feel it's only the start.  The paper mostly focused on social and emotional interactions, and mostly on people responding to what was happening.  I assume that this data would be most useful for designing gesture-based controls, although there are other possible applications.  However, gesture controls would likely only be somewhat influenced by these findings.  Although the gestures here are completely natural, they are not geared toward a system of remote control.  These are people reacting to the TV, and not trying to control it.  Even so, there are other ways the data could be useful.  Reading people's emotional state could be useful, say for profiling interests.  Or a system that adjusts the volume down if people become more focused on their conversation than the TV.</p>
<p>However, this research does bring up some important considerations when designing such a system.  There are going to be several people, and the main focus is rarely TV.  Gestures made between people will have to be filtered out, or the gestures will have to be of a kind that most people wouldn't do normally (although that seems to be the goal here).  And people will be making gestures simultaneously, so a system that picks up pointing or cheering will have to be robust enough to handle that.  And finally, the emphasis is rarely on TV; it's done for the social experience (although it'd be interesting to see how much this is the case for living room watching).  So any system of gestural interaction needs to be as unobtrusive as possible.</p>
<p>Overall, the study makes a good start for the considerations that would be needed for a gestural system of remote control.  However, another study would be needed to determine specific advice for such a system.</p>
