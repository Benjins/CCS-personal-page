Semester Project Proposal<br />

<div style="width:1000px">
<p>The goal for this project is to create a stripped-down, visual Git client suitable for use outside of technical fields.  Most Git clients are designed for use with code-bases, although Git itself works well with any iterated design on text files.  For instance, researchers working on a paper need to make incremental changes, synchronising them with one another, and keep old versions.  In this case, a common technology used is Track Changes in Word, however this is not cross-platform and does not have an elegant way of showing a complete history.</p>  
<p>However, a more complete solution like Git will not be ideal.  Most Git clients have a large number of features that directly translate to Git commands, and therefore use Git's terminology and workflow.  This is likely to turn off non-technical users.  But further, it creates a hassle for trying to learn to do simpler operations, such as seeing what has been changed, or committing.</p>  
<p>The target use case would be either the above example with a research paper, or an author writing a journal/book/etc.  The UI would be vastly stripped down compared to other Git clients (both to help the user, and to help the developer).</p>

<p><b>Core goals:</b></p>
<ul>
 <li> Create complete workflow for commiting work, retrieving old copies, showing progression</li>
 <li> Show history of file(s) in elegant way</li>
 <li> Diff view, showing differences between two files/versions</li>
 </ul>
 
 <p><b>Design philosophy:</b></p>
 <ul>
 <li> Minimise time in the program</li>
 <li> Minimise startup investment for learning</li>
 <li> Emphasise tracking changes, and non-destructive editing</li>
 </ul>
