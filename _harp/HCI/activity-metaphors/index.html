			<p class="header">Activity 1: Creating a revision.</p>
			<p>Sally is working on a physics paper for a conference.  She has recently been making changes to the Introduction.  She's relatively satisfied with her work, and now would like to work on the Methods section.  In case she's dissatisfied with her work in Methods, she decides to save a copy of her work so far.  She opens up the version control software, checks over her changes.  Seeing that she only changed the introduction, she's satisfied with the edits.  She then selects Create Revision.  She is prompted to write a description, which she enters "Added background to introduction."  She confirms the revision, and then goes back to her text editor.</p>

			<p class="header">Activity 2: Finding a past revision based on what was changed.</p>
			<p>Josh is looking over a paper that one of his research students is writing.  He looks at the latest version, and is displeased with one of her explanations.  He recalls that an earlier version had a better explanation, and so decides to find it.  He looks back over the past several revisions, seeing if any had made changes to that section of the paper.  When he finds one that did, he checks the differences between them.  He sees that the previous version does have a better wording, and so he sends an email to his colleague with the identifier (number) of the revision.</p>

			<p>Josh is reviewing some edits of a paper in preparation for its submission.  As there are many edits to look over, he decides to just look at the previous week's version, and the current one.  He selects the two revisions, and selects the difference button.  He scrolls through the difference view, checking all the week's changes.  He likes all the changes that are there, and gives his approval.  Instead of looking at each revision separately, he managed to look at the combination of the week's changes..</p>

	<p class="header">Conclusion</p>
	<p>For the actual project, I was planning on going for a mix of the filing cabinet and snapshot metaphors.  I don't really like the tree idea (even though it lends itself to branching/merging more so), because I feel it's too much rooted in the internals of version control for coding.  PaperVC is going to be simpler, and a filing cabinet is a more grounded metaphor.  It also communicates the idea that each revision is independent; i.e. it doesn't require the other versions.  A tree implies that each revision requires the previous (again, internals of the software aside, that's not true).  I also liked snapshot, because it signifies that the copy is independent of the original, and will remain unchanged.</p>
	<p>The only problem with the filing cabinet is that it doesn't translate the chronological aspect well.  Although it denotes some kind of sort, it's less clear that the papers are a progression through time.  But even so, I think the metaphor works better than the tree idea.</p>
