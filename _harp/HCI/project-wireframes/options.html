	<h2>Three options for history view</h2>
	<div class="option-container">
	<p><b>Option 1: Filing cabinet</b><br/>This is the approach I chose.  It still has the tree metaphor, but is a somewhat more grounded image.  It also provides a convenient way of enunciating the selected revision, e.g. pulling the file out or moving the others down.</p>
	<object class="" data="svg/PaperVC_Wireframe_option1.svg" type="image/svg+xml" alt="History view option one.">
	It seems your browser doesn't support SVG rendering.
	</object>
	</div>

	<div class="option-container">
	<p><b>Option 2: Vertical tree</b><br/>I didn't like this approach because I felt it was too abstract of a representation.  The main advantage would be it more closely fits Git's backend of branching/merging, but as shown above I found a way to do this in the filing cabinet approach.</p>
	<object data="svg/PaperVC_Wireframe_option2.svg" type="image/svg+xml" alt="History view option two.">

	</object>
	</div>
	
	<div class="option-container">
	<p><b>Option 1: Horizontal tree</b><br/>I didn't like this approach because I felt it was awkward to place the extra information all around the tree, and it was more difficult to create a sense of hierarchy.  It also doesn't have the same sense of chronology, at least to me.  Left to right doesn't immediately create a sense of recent vs. older like top-down does.  It seems odd, but that's what I felt from the wireframe.</p>
