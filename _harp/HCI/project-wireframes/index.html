		<h4>Interaction Scenarios:</h4>
		<p class="interaction-scen-title">Activity 1: Creating a revision.</p>
		<p>Sally is working on a physics paper for a conference.  She has recently been making changes to the Introduction section.  She's relatively satisfied with her work, and now would like to work on the Methods section.  In case she's dissatisfied with her work in Methods, she decides to save a copy of her work so far.  She opens up the version control software, checks over her changes.  Seeing that she only changed the introduction, she clicks on the file for more detail.  Sally scans over what lines she's specifically changed/added, and decides she's satisfied with the edits.  She then selects Create Revision.  She is prompted to write a description, to which she enters "Added background to introduction."  She confirms the revision, sees confirmation that the revision has been made, and then goes back to her text editor.</p>

		<p class="interaction-scen-title">Activity 2: Finding a past revision based on what was changed.</p>
		<p>Josh is looking over a paper that one of his research students is writing.  He looks at the latest version, and is displeased with one of her explanations.  He recalls that an earlier version had a better explanation, and so decides to find it.  He scans over the past several revisions, seeing if any had made changes to that section of the paper.  There were none, so he scrolls to see older revisions.  As he scans, he checks the files changed, as well as the list of the major changes to the file.  When he finds one that did, he checks the differences between it and the latest revision.  He sees that the previous version does have a better wording, and so he sends an email to his colleague with the identifier (number) of the revision.</p>

		<p class="interaction-scen-title">Activity 3: Seeing the past few changes.</p>
		<p>Josh is looking over a paper that one of his research students is writing.  He's interested in how much each of the co-authors have contributed, and what sections they've worked on.  He goes to the history view, and looks over this week's commits.  First he scans over the latest commits in he history view to see which were made this week, and the files each changed.  He clicks on each commit to get more detailed info on the specific changes it entails, and the author it was created by.</p>
